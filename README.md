# Muses Service Package

Quick & easy services.

## Installation

Install the package using npm: `npm install muses-service`

## Requirements

This package uses `node ^5.0.0` ES6/Harmony features. It should be possible to transpile it to ES5 but I leave that as an exercise for you.

## TODO

* Documentation, obviously.
* Examples! The unit tests should provide basic examples of how to use the package but some more comprehensive examples will be coming soon.
* Finish unit tests. Code coverage is around 91% so it is fairly complete but there is still more to do.
